# RSVP App
This is a project assigned by Treehouse. Most of the project files were given at the start, except for
the app.js file, which contained a couple variables and a few instructions. All of the work in the app.js
file is mine, but if I were to get stuck, I could work along side an instructional video to see
what I was doing wrong and adjust my own code. This is the most recent project I have done with Treehouse.
