# RSVP App
This is a project assigned by Treehouse. Most of the project files were given at the start, except for
the app.js file, which contained a couple variables and a few instructions. All of the work in
the app.js file I have written out and done myself, working along side instructional videos. Some
of the work was a challenge to do without instruction, and then I could come back and check the videos
for a solution to make the code run. And some of the code I wrote right along side the videos.
This is the most recent project I have done with Treehouse.
